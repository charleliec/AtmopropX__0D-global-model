# AtmopropX
Codes and simulations created during the PSC AtmopropX focusing on an air-breathing Gridded Ion Thruster.

To run project, instantiate all species and reactions in a file (e.g. `reaction_set_N_et_O.py`), import this file `run_single_simu.py` and then in the console, from the root directory execute :
```
python -m src.run_single_simu
```
